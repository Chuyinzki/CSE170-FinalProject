      <h3><left>What is Class App?</left></h3>
      <p>Class App is a website dedicated to help UCSD's Computer Science Major/Minor hopefulls
        figure out how fit their CS requirements in their schedules by offering guidance and 
        helpful tips that will ultimately put them on the CS Major/Minor path of their choosing!</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3><left>What can I do on Class App?</left></h3>
      <p>Class App has some tabs up at the top that can help you with what it is that you require!
        If you are looking for information on how to get that CS Minor under your belt, click "My Minor"
        up in the tab options or just simply <a href="/minor">click here!</a></p>

        <p>Another great option we have here at Class App is the option to view all the undergraduate courses
         that the Computer Science Department at UCSD has to offer! Here you have the ability to rate a class
         and view the ratings that other students have given them to give you an idea of what to expect from
         the required courses and an easy way to pick the electives you would like to take! To access this,
         click "Courses" up in the tab options or just simply <a href="/courses">click here!</a></p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3><left>What else can I do when I view courses?</left></h3>
      <p>Not only can you view the classes and their overall ratings, they come with the official
        course description, links to both "Rate My Professor" for the typical instructors for that
        class and UCSD's "Cape" reviews for an official overview! There is also a comment section
        where students like yourself can add your experience with the course, what you wish you could
        have done better, or simply some helpful tips for the next person coming around the corner!</p>
